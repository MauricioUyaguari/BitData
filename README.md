# BitData

## Background
Bitcoin has been making huge dents in the stock market as of later.  In order to better explained the changing price of bitcoin I plan to show historical data and tie it with the news of the day.  In order to successful do this, I used various APIS.  The Blockchain and Coindesk API provided me with historical and real time bitcoin price data.  The Google News API is a very useful API that shows the breaking news real time as they happen, as well as historical data.


## Technology Used
This project was completed with the JavaScript, jquery and the D3 library.  It also minimally uses other libraries. In order to see the data displayed it is import to run npm install
