# BitData

## Background
Bitcoin has been making huge dents in the stock market as of late.  I plan to show the rapid growth using data I obtained from kaggle. The dataset I obtained shows a minute by minute transaction of bitcoin from Jan 2012 to Jan 2018.


## Data
The full data set can be found [here- kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data).


## MVP

Using this data users will be able to see a minute by minute overview of the bitcoin market. They will see key data points such as open, close, high, low, volume and weighted price. Additionally, I plan to show other minute by minute information such as the weather to incorporate a more dynamic presentation of my data.

Main functionality of my BitData will be:

  * chose a date and time and click start and stop
  * will be able to show the changing stock markets through the minutes/ days/ months
  * Main features of bitcoin stock shown such as high, low, open and close price
  * Brief description of what bitcoin is and their process over the years


## Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented using the following Technologies:

  * Javascript
  * D3.js for Data Visual
  * bundle.js



## Wire Frame


## Implementation TimeLine

### Day 1
Will be spend getting familiar with the D3 library as well as setting up all the necessary files to start my project.  Additionally I will start organizing the data that I will be showing.  Will make a clear picture of what I will be showing after a quick overview of D3.
### Day 2

This day will be focus on showing the data in a clear and readable manner.  Will make it as interactive as I can.  

### Day 3
Continue on Day 2 goals.
